# Description

The original $P algorithm was implemented for 2D point clouds. This generalization works with full 3D gestures achieved by modern VR input devices like the Leap Motion, Oculus Touch or the HTC Vive.

For now, only a Leap Motion interface is provided, for lack of finalized hardware of the other 2 systems.
